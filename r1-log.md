### R1D0 - 3/31/2019
**Today's Progress**: 
Day 0 of #100DaysOfCode Challenge! I worked on exploring the new UIElements API that will be available for Editor UI in Unity 2019.x. I got my project setup and a repo established on Github (linked below) and created a bare-bones "Hello, World!" using the new VisualElement C# class.

**Thoughts**:
Project initialization always takes more time than I expect, especially on an OS I'm not familiar with (Windows). Although, from just initializing the "Hello, World!", I get a giddy feeling that I'll find this a lot more comfortable for creating Editor UI coming from a web-developer background! I'm excited to play around with the UXML and USS next! :)
