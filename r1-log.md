# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Alexander Anich

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on March 31st, Sunday, 2019.

## Log

### R1D0 - 3/31/2019
**Today's Progress**: 
Day 0 of #100DaysOfCode Challenge! I worked on exploring the new UIElements API that will be available for Editor UI in Unity 2019.x. I got my project setup and a repo established on Github (linked below) and created a bare-bones "Hello, World!" using the new VisualElement C# class.

**Thoughts**:
Project initialization always takes more time than I expect, especially on an OS I'm not familiar with (Windows). Although, from just initializing the "Hello, World!", I get a giddy feeling that I'll find this a lot more comfortable for creating Editor UI coming from a web-developer background! I'm excited to play around with the UXML and USS next! :)

### R1D1 - 4/1/2019
**Today's Progress**: 
Day 1 of #100DaysOfCode Challenge! Continuing exploration of the UIElements API. Created a layout of visual elements using the FlexBox implementation available as a part of UIElements.

**Thoughts**:
I'm glad that the FlexBox API is mostly what I expected it to be. One thing that I found lacking was that there was not a "justifySelf" option, which made it difficult to add justification to a specific element among a list of others.

### R1D2 - 4/2/2019
**Today's Progress**: 
Moved all of the inline-styles into a schnazy new USS file. Experimented with extending the VisualElement class into new Components, as opposed to building them inline. Also used the Manipulator class to turn the boxes red on click.

**Thoughts**:
I think there is a lot of potential in this new system, given that Unity is providing good primitive components to work with I suspect that porting a web Frontend framework will not be so hard (if it deserves to be here.)
