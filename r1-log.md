## Log

### R1D0 - 3/31/2019
**Today's Progress**: 
Day 0 of #100DaysOfCode Challenge! I worked on exploring the new UIElements API that will be available for Editor UI in Unity 2019.x. I got my project setup and a repo established on Github (linked below) and created a bare-bones "Hello, World!" using the new VisualElement C# class.

**Thoughts**:
Project initialization always takes more time than I expect, especially on an OS I'm not familiar with (Windows). Although, from just initializing the "Hello, World!", I get a giddy feeling that I'll find this a lot more comfortable for creating Editor UI coming from a web-developer background! I'm excited to play around with the UXML and USS next! :)

### R1D1 - 4/1/2019
**Today's Progress**: 
Day 1 of #100DaysOfCode Challenge! Continuing exploration of the UIElements API. Created a layout of visual elements using the FlexBox implementation available as a part of UIElements.

**Thoughts**:
I'm glad that the FlexBox API is mostly what I expected it to be. One thing that I found lacking was that there was not a "justifySelf" option, which made it difficult to add justification to a specific element among a list of others.
